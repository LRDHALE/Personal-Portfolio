# My Portfolio Website!

This is my beginner portfolio website built in HTML & CSS only.

## Features ✨

- Responsive design 📱
- HTML/CSS only 🖥️
- Leave a message (coming soon!) 💬

## How to Run 🚀

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/LRDHALE/Personal-Portfolio.git`  
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Image Guidelines

To maintain optimal website performance:
- All images should be optimized before committing
- Maximum image dimensions: 800x800 pixels
- Use WebP format with PNG/JPG fallback
- Maximum file size: 200KB for photos, 100KB for screenshots
- Use TinyPNG/TinyJPG or ImageMagick for optimization

To optimize new images:
1. Run `./optimize-images.sh` (requires ImageMagick)
2. Use `<picture>` element with WebP and fallback in HTML

## Improvements 🛠️

- Plan to create a dynamic project tile using React
- Future upgrade: rebuild the entire portfolio using React for better scalability and interactivity
